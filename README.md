# TaskList App!

# Why did I make this app?
I made this because I wanted to learn how to efficently add and delete data in a real world setting. This project was also a test
for myself on how to effectively use .appendChild() and other methods.
# How it's made
I made functions for each feature of the task list. This includes : Filtering, deleting, storing, adding, and finding tasks. 
Adding and deleting items on a tasklist was the crux of this project. Adding an item involed creating a 
function that creates a list element of the typed values and then appending that item as a child to the main list element.
Deleting involed removing a list item from the tasklist (using .remove()) and the tasklist storage by splicing the index of the 
deleted item.
